  // TODO - change this into a compounded requirement instead of 3000, 2000, 1000+ electives. Works as expected right now though.
  // TODO - "language courses" cannot be used for this requirement, but some courses with language course codes can. Unless we have a way of checking
  // "FL" designations besides the broad subjects we do now, we can't restrict this.
  // TODO - The CU-UGR restriction should probably be part of this compounded requirement as well. Right now assumes a CU-UGR course in linguistics is 3000+ and the language is confusing.
  // TODO - The CU-UGR restriction restricts to only allow courses that could possibly be 4 credits, but a user could edit it to 3 or fewer credits and it would still count when it shouldn't.
