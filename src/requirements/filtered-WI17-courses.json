In addition, more and more companies are going abroad to pursue their major business objectives. How can they take advantage of the global marketplace and create economic value through their multimarket activities? This course has three integrated objectives: first, to give you a basic grounding in global business, so that you can become capable of understanding and analyzing events and trends in the global business environment and their impact on managerial decision making; second, to help you understand the analytical frameworks on strategy formulation and implementation in an international context; and third, through a series of concrete case discussions and a local product internationalization project, the course aims at developing your practical skills in applying the tools of global strategic analysis in concrete business situations. Its ultimate goal is to help you become better prepared to serve in and lead business organizations in today's globalized world.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Winter.","catalogComments":"Johnson School students will not receive credit for winter session courses offered through Continuing Education.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"GM"},{"crseId":351456,"subject":"NS","catalogNbr":"1150","titleLong":"Nutrition, Health, and Society","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1033,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/03/2017","endDt":"01/21/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dal4","firstName":"David","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Levitsky"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Online Winter Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.
