How can they take advantage of the global marketplace and create economic value through their multimarket activities? This course has three integrated objectives: first, to give you a basic grounding in global business, so that you can become capable of understanding and analyzing events and trends in the global business environment and their impact on managerial decision making; second, to help you understand the analytical frameworks on strategy formulation and implementation in an international context; and third, through a series of concrete case discussions and a local product internationalization project, the course aims at developing your practical skills in applying the tools of global strategic analysis in concrete business situations. Its ultimate goal is to help you become better prepared to serve in and lead business organizations in today's globalized world.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer, Winter.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with a section of AEM 4940.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"crseId":367049,"subject":"NBAY","catalogNbr":"5920","titleLong":"ITrek Trip","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"FLD","ssrComponentLong":"Field Studies","section":"801","classNbr":1087,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/06/2019","endDt":"01/16/2019","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rjb397","firstName":"Ronald","middleName":"Jay","lastName":"Brachman"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in Israel.

Working with local grassroots animal welfare organizations and pet owners in small communities, we will learn how to communicate with them to take medical histories and educate them on aspects of pet health and wellness, and learn more about the human/animal bond in other countries. Students will participate in sterilization surgery procedures with supervision and instruction of veterinarians. Participants will also have opportunities to learn about local cultures and veterinary issues in the areas visited.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-CEL, CU-ITL)","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, Spring, Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"VM","acadGroup":"VM"},{"crseId":352769,"subject":"VTMED","catalogNbr":"6798","titleLong":"Special Projects in Veterinary Medicine","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":1113,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"12/17/2018","endDt":"01/20/2019","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"rwr32","firstName":"Robin","middleName":"William","lastName":"Radcliffe"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"12/17/2018","endDt":"01/20/2019","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":0.5,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"12/17/2018","sessionEndDt":"01/20/2019","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Students work individually with a faculty member to pursue an area of particular interest that, typically, is not part of the established curriculum.
