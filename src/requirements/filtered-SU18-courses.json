In this course we will examine the human infant as a biologically designed organism that has co-evolved with caretakers, and then look at the various parenting styles across cultures that also mold our young.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"crseId":352394,"subject":"ARCH","catalogNbr":"1102","titleLong":"Design II","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"STU","ssrComponentLong":"Studio","section":"501","classNbr":1056,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"05:00PM","startDt":"06/04/2018","endDt":"07/27/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"rr95","firstName":"Richard","middleName":"","lastName":"Rosa"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"Milstein Hall 201","bldgDescr":"Milstein Hall","facilityDescrshort":"MLS201","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

Sculpture can also be made out of literally anything, and each \"anything\" already comes with its own meanings and associations. All of these are givens, even before we decide what our work is about. This is what makes sculpture so powerful and exciting, and also so challenging.

This seminar offers students from diverse backgrounds a forum in which to move beyond accustomed boundaries, finding agency not only through use of the first-person voice but through increased confidence in their abilities as writers.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"crseId":352716,"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"2270","titleLong":"Shakespeare","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1173,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:30AM","timeEnd":"12:45PM","startDt":"06/25/2018","endDt":"08/03/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"pal37","firstName":"Philip","middleName":"","lastName":"Lorenz"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 260","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH260","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

Philosophers and poets for a few thousand years have contemplated the close kinship between madness and genius and have engaged in lively discussions about changing definitions of creativity as either ingenuity, inspiration, or insanity; as stemming from divine possession, originality, or fanatic enthusiasm. By reading philosophical and medical treatises, by examining texts of fiction and lyric poetry, as well as by including historical accounts, this course will find out when and why our culture decided to call a madman a genius and a genius mad. We shall trace the history of social and artistic transgression and analyze when and why a culture considers great talent as \"too different,\" as \"pathological,\" or as \"un-normal.\" You shall read texts ranging from Antiquity to the 18th and 20th centuries and encounter authors from Germany, France, Britain, and the United States.

In the second, we will consider two different lenses through which we might peer to evaluate policies. In the third, we will discuss the main lines of debate in contemporary American politics concerning four substantive issues: crime and punishment, education, the economy and foreign trade, and foreign policy.

In addition, more and more companies are going abroad to pursue their major business objectives. How can they take advantage of the global marketplace and create economic value through their multimarket activities? This course has three integrated objectives: first, to give you a basic grounding in global business, so that you can become capable of understanding and analyzing events and trends in the global business environment and their impact on managerial decision making; second, to help you understand the analytical frameworks on strategy formulation and implementation in an international context; and third, through a series of concrete case discussions and a local product internationalization project, the course aims at developing your practical skills in applying the tools of global strategic analysis in concrete business situations. Its ultimate goal is to help you become better prepared to serve in and lead business organizations in today's globalized world.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Winter.","catalogComments":"Johnson School students will not receive credit for winter session courses offered through Continuing Education.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"crseId":350801,"subject":"NCC","catalogNbr":"5090","titleLong":"Strategy","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1586,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"11:45AM","startDt":"07/12/2018","endDt":"07/13/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"tj268","firstName":"Thomas","middleName":"","lastName":"Jungbauer"}],"pattern":"RF","facilityDescr":"Breazzano Family Ctr 123","bldgDescr":"Breazzano Family Ctr for BusEd","facilityDescrshort":"BRZ123","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"11:45AM","startDt":"07/16/2018","endDt":"07/20/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"tj268","firstName":"Thomas","middleName":"","lastName":"Jungbauer"}],"pattern":"MTRF","facilityDescr":"Breazzano Family Ctr 123","bldgDescr":"Breazzano Family Ctr for BusEd","facilityDescrshort":"BRZ123","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":3,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"11:45AM","startDt":"07/23/2018","endDt":"07/27/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"tj268","firstName":"Thomas","middleName":"","lastName":"Jungbauer"}],"pattern":"MTRF","facilityDescr":"Breazzano Family Ctr 123","bldgDescr":"Breazzano Family Ctr for BusEd","facilityDescrshort":"BRZ123","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"07/12/2018","endDt":"07/27/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2.5,"unitsMaximum":2.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"05/30/2018","sessionEndDt":"08/07/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"002","classNbr":1587,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"03:45PM","startDt":"07/12/2018","endDt":"07/13/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"tj268","firstName":"Thomas","middleName":"","lastName":"Jungbauer"}],"pattern":"RF","facilityDescr":"Breazzano Family Ctr 123","bldgDescr":"Breazzano Family Ctr for BusEd","facilityDescrshort":"BRZ123","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":2,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"03:45PM","startDt":"07/16/2018","endDt":"07/20/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"tj268","firstName":"Thomas","middleName":"","lastName":"Jungbauer"}],"pattern":"MTRF","facilityDescr":"Breazzano Family Ctr 123","bldgDescr":"Breazzano Family Ctr for BusEd","facilityDescrshort":"BRZ123","meetingTopicDescription":""},{"classMtgNbr":3,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"03:45PM","startDt":"07/23/2018","endDt":"07/27/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"tj268","firstName":"Thomas","middleName":"","lastName":"Jungbauer"}],"pattern":"MTRF","facilityDescr":"Breazzano Family Ctr 123","bldgDescr":"Breazzano Family Ctr for BusEd","facilityDescrshort":"BRZ123","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"07/12/2018","endDt":"07/27/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":2.5,"unitsMaximum":2.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"05/30/2018","sessionEndDt":"08/07/2018","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Among the critical tasks facing any senior manager are the creation, implementation, and evaluation of a business unit's strategy.

Salsa, arguably the most popular social dance in the world, derives from the Cuban rhythm of Son, while it grew to world fame through its growth in New York City and Puerto Rico. The development of Salsa as a dance form follows its development as a musical genre. Bachata and Merengue, meanwhile, are considered quintessential dances of the Dominican Republic. Comparsa is Cuban Carnival line dance. In this course, we learn the basics of all of these dances. Instruction emphasizes the development of dance foundations in musical timing, rhythm, body movement, lead-follow connection, and space use. Class begins with a stretching and body movement warm-up. We then teach dance steps and movement patterns across the floor, in rotating lines, as freestyle, and in partner format. The skills learned in each dance are interrelated - as you improve in one you will improve in the others. Dancing with live percussion at one or more of our classes will help connect the dots of timing, rhythm and motion. By the end of this course you will be able to take Latin dance to a higher level and pick up other partnered dances. No partner is necessary to register. Couple sign-up is encouraged. Partners rotate. This class is gender-free. Each student is free to learn the lead or follow role.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AT"},{"crseId":350373,"subject":"PE","catalogNbr":"1321","titleLong":"Recreational Golf","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"002","classNbr":1602,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"05/30/2018","endDt":"06/22/2018","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

political theorists to respond to them: Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Burke, Mill, Marx, and Nietzsche.  In each case, we will attend to the particular crises these theorists addressed in their work—such as the European wars of religion, the English Civil War, colonialism, the French Revolution, and industrial capitalism—as well as the broader philosophical and political issues they continue to pose to us now.  Our approach will be both historical and conceptual, in other words, with the hopes of providing students with a nuanced but clear understanding of political theory as a

The first half of the course will focus on various first-order ethical theories, which offer criteria of morally right action. These will include consequentialist and deontological approaches, and also broadly virtue-theoretic approaches, which place more emphasis on the notion of moral character and/or are critical of focusing exclusively on what one ought to do as opposed to who one ought to be. The second half of the course will examine some of the more abstract questions about the nature of morality which are the province of twentieth-century metaethics. What is the nature of moral properties? Where in the world might they be located? Are they objective, subjective, and/or relative to particular times and places? What is the connection between morality, moral judgments, and being motivated to act morally? Interspersed with these theoretical ethical issues will be more concrete ethical questions about what to do as individuals in an often unjust social world.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(KCM-AS)","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"crseId":355142,"subject":"PHYS","catalogNbr":"1101","titleLong":"General Physics I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1316,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:00AM","timeEnd":"02:00PM","startDt":"06/11/2018","endDt":"08/03/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"gsc11","firstName":"Glenn","middleName":"","lastName":"Case"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"Rockefeller Hall 280","bldgDescr":"Rockefeller Hall","facilityDescrshort":"RCK280","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

Lab animal veterinarians assist researchers in achieving their goals, while encouraging replacement, reduction, and refinement of animal use. Treatment of animals and preparation of preventive medicine programs requires the laboratory animal veterinarian to have knowledge of the biology and comparative medicine of a wide variety of species. It is also essential for laboratory animal veterinarians to have knowledge of research methodologies, and animal models of disease as well as a good understanding of state and federal regulations, and guidelines governing the use of animals. In addition, occupational health and safety, and animal facility design are important parts of an institutional animal care program, to which laboratory animal veterinarians have input.

The student is expected to assist in all aspects of the rotation, including patient receiving, medical and surgical treatments, client communication, and record-keeping.
