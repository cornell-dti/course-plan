It also traces the bilateral relationship between China and Cambodia, paying special attention on the Khmer Rouge era (1975-1979). The course assumes no prior knowledge of China or Cambodia, although it would be a good idea for students to do some reading in advance of the class. We will combine lectures, discussions and field research, culminating with a final exam at the end of the course. Most of the lectures and discussions will take place at Wat Damnak in Siem Reap, with field trips to Angkor, Phnom Penh, Phnom Kulen, Anlong Veng, and Kampong Chhnang.","catalogBreadth":"(GB)","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogWhenOffered":"Winter.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"crseId":364989,"subject":"HADM","catalogNbr":"3135","titleLong":"Conversations with Entrepreneurs","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1026,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/02/2015","endDt":"01/17/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mao24","firstName":"Mona Anita","middleName":"Kristiansen","lastName":"Olsen"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"For more information go to: http://www.sce.cornell.edu/ws/courses/courses.php?v=2977"}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/02/2015","endDt":"01/17/2015","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"DW","instrModeDescrshort":"DL WWW","instrModeDescr":"Distance Learning - WWW","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Sat - Unsat Exclusively(SUI)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"WS","sessionBeginDt":"01/02/2015","sessionEndDt":"01/17/2015","sessionLong":"Winter Session"}],"description":"This course is intended to expose students to the entrepreneurial journey.

Students will learn about noted patrons of the arts, such as the Medici family in Renaissance Italy, our main focus will be on the creation of a global art market in the twentieth century. Using case studies, sample topics include: patterns of transportation, exchange and trade; the interaction of collectors, critics and curators; the spaces and contexts of display of contemporary collections; auction houses and commercial galleries; and fakes, forgeries, thefts and scandals. Special attention will be paid to considering the contemporary art market (post 1980) and the collecting, exchange and valuation of film, photography, painting, performance and installation art.
