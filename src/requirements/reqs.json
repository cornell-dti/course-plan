The three courses must be related to each other. Frequently, the three courses are from the same department, e.g., OR&IE 3300 (Optimization I), OR&IE 3310 (Optimization II), and OR&IE 4330 (Discrete Models). However, a great strength of Cornell is the multitude of interdisciplinary threads that cut across departmental boundaries. Thus, Psychology 4150 (Concepts, Categories, and Word Meanings), Philosophy 3320 (Philosophy of Language), and Linguistics 5530 (Representation of Structure in Vision and Language) define an acceptable Specialization.",
