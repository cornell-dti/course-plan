  *all* of these have to be available for the course to be scheduled.
  will usually just be one, but if there is e.g. a lab or a discussion then it could be two
  for now, just going to have multiple copies of the course.
  
  say we have one lecture L and two discussions D1 and D2.
  then there would be generated:

  Course(code=L, timeslots=[LectureTimeslot, D1Timeslot])
  Course(code=L, timeslots=[LectureTimeslot, D2Timeslot])

  then the algorithm will just choose one of these to schedule
