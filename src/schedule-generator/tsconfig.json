// This file is only here for the purpose of being able to run `testing.ts` with `ts-node`.
// Eventually, once we have frontend tests or whatnot, we can remove this file (as well as `testing.ts`
// for that matter).

// If you get some complaint about `ts-node` not being defined you should just install it globally:
// `npm install -g ts-node typescript "@types/node"`,
