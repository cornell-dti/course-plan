Philosophers and poets for a few thousand years have contemplated the close kinship between madness and genius and have engaged in lively discussions about changing definitions of creativity as either ingenuity, inspiration, or insanity; as stemming from divine possession, originality, or fanatic enthusiasm. By reading philosophical and medical treatises, by examining texts of fiction and lyric poetry, as well as by including historical accounts, this course will find out when and why our culture decided to call a madman a genius and a genius mad. We shall trace the history of social and artistic transgression and analyze when and why a culture considers great talent as \"too different,\" as \"pathological,\" or as \"un-normal.\" You shall read texts ranging from Antiquity to the 18th and 20th centuries and encounter authors from Germany, France, Britain, and the United States. Guest lecturers from various Humanities departments will expand our view on genius as either a human condition, an artistic invention or the delusive state of \"madness.\"","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"Taught in English.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Does not count toward major or minor.","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"crseId":351397,"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"1615","titleLong":"Introduction to Modern Political Theory","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1060,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"06/26/2017","endDt":"08/04/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"ik15","firstName":"Isaac","middleName":"","lastName":"Kramnick"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Online Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

political theorists to respond to them: Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Burke, Mill, Marx, and Nietzsche.  In each case, we will attend to the particular crises these theorists addressed in their work—such as the European wars of religion, the English Civil War, colonialism, the French Revolution, and industrial capitalism—as well as the broader philosophical and political issues they continue to pose to us now.  Our approach will be both historical and conceptual, in other words, with the hopes of providing students with a nuanced but clear understanding of political theory as a

We analyze the consistency between personal and professional ethics, the importance of moral character and agency, and the translation of moral thought to ethical action, and address the development of professional and personal ethical codes of conduct and research for communication professionals in the areas of new media and technology.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AG, CA-AS)","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"EN"},{"crseId":358814,"subject":"INFO","catalogNbr":"4900","titleLong":"Independent Reading and Research","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":1805,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"06/09/2017","endDt":"08/19/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"kl838","firstName":"Karen","middleName":"","lastName":"Levy"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"06/09/2017","endDt":"08/19/2017","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"SP2","sessionBeginDt":"05/31/2017","sessionEndDt":"08/08/2017","sessionLong":"Summer Special Session 2"}],"description":"Independent reading and research for undergraduates.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-UGR)","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"EN"},{"crseId":366025,"subject":"LAW","catalogNbr":"6005","titleLong":"Business and Financial Concepts for Lawyers","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1817,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"06/05/2017","endDt":"06/23/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dm727","firstName":"Diogo","middleName":"","lastName":"Magalhaes"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This course is offered through eCornell."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"06/05/2017","endDt":"06/23/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"DW","instrModeDescrshort":"DL WWW","instrModeDescr":"Distance Learning - WWW","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"05/31/2017","sessionEndDt":"08/08/2017","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This 1-credit course is designed to prepare students who have no business background for (1) legal practice in areas involving business transactions, business regulation, and/or business litigation, and (2) taking upper-level business courses such as Business Organizations, Securities Regulation, Financial Regulation, Banking, Corporate Finance, and Bankruptcy. The course is offered on an accelerated basis. The course introduces students to basic business concepts that are fundamental to business practice and to upper-level business courses, but that many students are unlikely to be familiar with if they did not major in business at the undergraduate level. In particular, the course will provide a basic introduction to the following concepts: Debt, Interest, and Present Value; Basic Business Forms (proprietorship, partnership, corporation, LLC); Capital Structure (equity, debt, and variations on the same like preferred and ABS); Basic Accounting (balance sheets, earnings statements, statements of cash flow); Basic Valuation (book value, discounted

Even purely domestic firms have to deal with international issues, be it in the form of imported supplies or foreign competitors. In addition, more and more companies are going abroad to pursue their major business objectives. How can they take advantage of the global marketplace and create economic value through their multimarket activities? This course has three integrated objectives: first, to give you a basic grounding in global business, so that you can become capable of understanding and analyzing events and trends in the global business environment and their impact on managerial decision making; second, to help you understand the analytical frameworks on strategy formulation and implementation in an international context; and third, through a series of concrete case discussions and a local product internationalization project, the course aims at developing your practical skills in applying the tools of global strategic analysis in concrete business situations. Its ultimate goal is to help you become better prepared to serve in and lead business organizations in today's globalized world.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Winter.","catalogComments":"Johnson School students will not receive credit for winter session courses offered

there has been quite a lot of research done on those topics.  What has been missing, and what this course will emphasize, is how to translate those research findings into practical tools, changing how

Salsa, arguably the most popular social dance in the world, derives from the Cuban rhythm of Son, while it grew to world fame through its growth in New York City and Puerto Rico. The development of Salsa as a dance form follows its development as a musical genre. Bachata and Merengue, meanwhile, are considered quintessential dances of the Dominican Republic. Comparsa is Cuban Carnival line dance. In this course, we learn the basics of all of these dances. Instruction emphasizes the development of dance foundations in musical timing, rhythm, body movement, lead-follow connection, and space use. Class begins with a stretching and body movement warm-up. We then teach dance steps and movement patterns across the floor, in rotating lines, as freestyle, and in partner format. The skills learned in each dance are interrelated - as you improve in one you will improve in the others. Dancing with live percussion at one or more of our classes will help connect the dots of timing, rhythm and motion. By the end of this course you will be able to take Latin dance to a higher level and pick up other partnered dances. No partner is necessary to register. Couple sign-up is encouraged. Partners rotate. This class is gender-free. Each student is free to learn the lead or follow role.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AT"},{"crseId":350373,"subject":"PE","catalogNbr":"1321","titleLong":"Recreational Golf","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"002","classNbr":1018,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"05/31/2017","endDt":"06/23/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":"Cornell Golf Center 101","bldgDescr":"Cornell Golf Center","facilityDescrshort":"CGC101","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"05/31/2017","endDt":"06/23/2017","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"3WK","sessionBeginDt":"05/31/2017","sessionEndDt":"06/23/2017","sessionLong":"Three Week Summer"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1016,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"06/26/2017","endDt":"08/04/2017","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":"Cornell Golf Center 101","bldgDescr":"Cornell Golf Center","facilityDescrshort":"CGC101","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

Humans are a social species and our connection to others is a core element of our experience. The course will examine how and why different people act differently in the same situation, sometimes as a result of the culture in which they were raised, the family in which they grew up, or the genetic make-up they inherited. The course will also examine how and why different situations, especially social situations, channel behavior in particular directions, minimizing and overcoming differences between individuals. In discussing these themes, the course will address such questions as: Why do we hold stereotypes? How do we decide what motivates other people's actions? How are beliefs and attitudes formed and changed? How do invisible social norms influence our behavior? What factors determine whom we like and love? What is the nature of emotional experience? Why are people capable of great cruelty and inspiring altruism? Along the way, students will learn how these questions can be scientifically studied, so that our knowledge of human behavior can rest on a solid foundation and go beyond the speculations offered by philosophers, poets, and other astute observers for millennia.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"crseId":353568,"subject":"PSYCH","catalogNbr":"1500","titleLong":"Introduction to Environmental Psychology","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1664,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:30AM","timeEnd":"12:45PM","startDt":"06/26/2017","endDt":"08/04/2017","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"ugv2","firstName":"Uchita","middleName":"","lastName":"Vaid"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 498","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH498","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"06/26/2017","endDt":"08/04/2017","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"COGST","catalogNbr":"1500","type":"C"},{"subject":"DEA","catalogNbr":"1500","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"6WK","sessionBeginDt":"06/26/2017","sessionEndDt":"08/04/2017","sessionLong":"Six Week Summer"}],"description":"Environmental Psychology is an interdisciplinary field concerned with how the physical environment and human behavior interrelate.

Lab animal veterinarians assist researchers in achieving their goals, while encouraging replacement, reduction, and refinement of animal use. Treatment of animals and preparation of preventive medicine programs requires the laboratory animal veterinarian to have knowledge of the biology and comparative medicine of a wide variety of species. It is also essential for laboratory animal veterinarians to have knowledge of research methodologies, and animal models of disease as well as a good understanding of state and federal regulations, and guidelines governing the use of animals. In addition, occupational health and safety, and animal facility design are important parts of an institutional animal care program, to which laboratory animal veterinarians have input. The diversity of species, and the novel circumstances that arise regularly in this field make laboratory animal medicine an exciting and unique discipline of veterinary medicine.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: VTMED
