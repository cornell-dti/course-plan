It is in our space, it makes us move in a certain way and it makes us want to move in a certain way. Because sculpture is physical like us, we respond to it on a visceral level. Sculpture can also be made out of literally anything, and each \"anything\" already comes with its own meanings and associations. All of these are givens, even before we decide what our work is about. This is what makes sculpture so powerful and exciting, and also so challenging. This course begins by exploring these givens though a number of very specific assignments and discussions.

The course will consider the main currents of modernism with a focus on both formal analysis and historical context: Neoclassicism and Romanticism, Realism, Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, Expressionism, Cubism, Futurism, the Russian and Soviet avant-garde, Abstraction, Dada and Surrealism, the School of Paris and Abstract Expressionism. Major themes will include the onset of capitalist development within a metropole-colonial world system, the arrival of new scientific and technological discoveries promising transformations of everyday life, the emergence of new forms of individual and collective experience, and the impact of revolutionary political alignments on avant-garde practice and the novel theorizations which addressed it. Finally, the course will consider the formative encounters of various modernisms with a non-European world of art, and offer critical perspectives on the contemporary philosophical responses to this encounter. Considers modern art in a historical and cultural context, from painting associated with the French Revolution through American pop art. The emphasis is on major movements and artists: Neo-Classicism (David), Romanticism (Delacroix), Realism (Courbet), Impressionism (Monet), Post-Impressionism (Van Gogh), Cubism (Picasso), Fauvism (Matisse), Surrealism (Miro), Abstract Expressionism (Pollock), and Pop Art (Warhol).

It presumes no pre-requisites or artistic abilities.  It is an introductory level course for non-designers and designers alike which examines how design affects you personally and globally, and how you can affect design process to innovate in various fields.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"HE"},{"crseId":353568,"subject":"DEA","catalogNbr":"1500","titleLong":"Introduction to Environmental Psychology","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1101,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:00AM","timeEnd":"11:15AM","startDt":"06/24/2019","endDt":"08/02/2019","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"ksp66","firstName":"Kathryn","middleName":"Sandra","lastName":"Peditto"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 262","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH262","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

This course explores these and other questions, inquiring into how new technology shapes the patterns and processes of global development. To do so, we will analyze the ways that tech has been historically intertwined with the development project, and draw on new work from information science, STS, and critical data studies to consider how contemporary cyber frontiers might create and cross the 'digital divide' between rich and poor, urban and rural, Global North and Global South.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer (six-week session).","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG"},{"crseId":370298,"subject":"DSOC","catalogNbr":"2130","titleLong":"Mother Nature Fights Back?

How can we produce enough nutritious food for the growing population and improve the standard of living, while sustaining Earth's diminishing natural resources, avoiding catastrophic climate change, and perhaps even leaving room for the planet's other inhabitants? This is especially critical in developing countries where rural and urban people are experiencing rapid transformation – and stark choices. In one semester, we can't solve all these problems, but we will seek to understand how the use and management of natural resources and the history of development and globalization are intertwined with global food security and health, culture and identity, livelihood security, and intergenerational environmental justice.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(HA-AG, SBA-AG)","catalogAttribute":"(CU-SBY)","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer (six-week session).","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG"},{"crseId":360974,"subject":"EAS","catalogNbr":"1108","titleLong":"Earth in the News","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1447,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"06:00PM","timeEnd":"09:15PM","startDt":"06/24/2019","endDt":"08/02/2019","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"rmr16","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Ross"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Snee Hall Geological Sci 2154","bldgDescr":"Snee Hall Geological Science","facilityDescrshort":"SNE2154","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

Our writing practice is both \"creative\" and \"analytical.\" We discover how writers use drafting and revision as a process of thinking, and in weekly workshops we practice the kind of revision that can make us more independent as writers and more capable of giving helpful suggestions to friends who are also writers. The most important texts for the course are the essays of students enrolled in it; but we also read and discuss personal memoirs. This seminar offers students from diverse backgrounds a forum in which to move beyond accustomed boundaries, finding agency not only through use of the first-person voice but through increased confidence in their abilities as writers.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"First-Year Writing Seminar.","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"crseId":352756,"subject":"ENGL","catalogNbr":"2800","titleLong":"Creative Writing","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","ssrComponentLong":"Seminar","section":"101","classNbr":1107,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"11:00AM","timeEnd":"01:30PM","startDt":"05/29/2019","endDt":"06/21/2019","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"mem35","firstName":"Maureen","middleName":"","lastName":"McCoy"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall 236","bldgDescr":"Goldwin Smith Hall","facilityDescrshort":"GSH236","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

Philosophers and poets for a few thousand years have contemplated the close kinship between madness and genius and have engaged in lively discussions about changing definitions of creativity as either ingenuity, inspiration, or insanity; as stemming from divine possession, originality, or fanatic enthusiasm. By reading philosophical and medical treatises, by examining texts of fiction and lyric poetry, as well as by including historical accounts, this course will find out when and why our culture decided to call a madman a genius and a genius mad. We shall trace the history of social and artistic transgression and analyze when and why a culture considers great talent as \"too different,\" as \"pathological,\" or as \"un-normal.\" You shall read texts ranging from Antiquity to the 18th and 20th centuries and encounter authors from Germany, France, Britain, and the United States.

Through lectures, readings, discussions, and short assignments, we will address contemporary challenges ranging from privacy in big data and social computing to the nature of innovation, property, and collaboration in a networked world. We will cover key areas of technology law and policy such as telecommunications and network policy; concentration and antitrust; free speech and the first amendment; intellectual property; and privacy, security and freedom of information. We will also address new ethical questions and controversies that law and policy has yet to sort out. Through this course you'll learn about the key frameworks, processes, and institutions that govern the contemporary world of technology, along with key theories and methods from the academic fields that shape and inform them (law, philosophy, economics, political science, communication, sociology, etc.). You'll also learn core writing and analytic skills central to success in the worlds of social science, law, policy, and many other settings. But above all you'll learn to engage critically and strategically with the worlds of information and technology around you, deciding what kind of information consumer, user, and citizen YOU want to be.  ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring, Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"EN"},{"crseId":360989,"subject":"INFO","catalogNbr":"2450","titleLong":"Communication and Technology","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1620,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"12:00PM","startDt":"05/29/2019","endDt":"06/21/2019","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"sp2333","firstName":"Swati","middleName":"","lastName":"Pandita"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"Warren Hall 137","bldgDescr":"Warren Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WRN137","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

Even purely domestic firms have to deal with international issues, be it in the form of imported supplies or foreign competitors. In addition, more and more companies are going abroad to pursue their major business objectives. How can they take advantage of the global marketplace and create economic value through their multimarket activities? This course has three integrated objectives: first, to give you a basic grounding in global business, so that you can become capable of understanding and analyzing events and trends in the global business environment and their impact on managerial decision making; second, to help you understand the analytical frameworks on strategy formulation and implementation in an international context; and third, through a series of concrete case discussions and a local product internationalization project, the course aims at developing your practical skills in applying the tools of global strategic analysis in concrete business situations. Its ultimate goal is to help you become better prepared to serve in and lead business organizations in today's globalized world.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer, Winter.","catalogComments":"Co-meets with a section of AEM 4940.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"crseId":350446,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6080","titleLong":"Building Entrepreneurial Ventures","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1672,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"04:00PM","startDt":"08/02/2019","endDt":"08/09/2019","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mvk34","firstName":"Mukti","middleName":"Vishvanath","lastName":"Khaire"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"Breazzano Family Ctr 123","bldgDescr":"Breazzano Family Ctr for BusEd","facilityDescrshort":"BRZ123","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/02/2019","endDt":"08/09/2019","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"05/29/2019","sessionEndDt":"08/06/2019","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":null,"catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"crseId":370438,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6325","titleLong":"Business-Tech Lectures","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1673,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"08/02/2019","endDt":"08/09/2019","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mvk34","firstName":"Mukti","middleName":"Vishvanath","lastName":"Khaire"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/02/2019","endDt":"08/09/2019","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":0.5,"unitsMaximum":0.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"05/29/2019","sessionEndDt":"08/06/2019","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":null,"catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"crseId":350658,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6550","titleLong":"Introduction to SQL","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1671,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"12:00PM","startDt":"08/02/2019","endDt":"08/09/2019","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"spm263","firstName":"Shawn","middleName":"","lastName":"Mankad"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"Breazzano Family Ctr 123","bldgDescr":"Breazzano Family Ctr for BusEd","facilityDescrshort":"BRZ123","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"08/02/2019","endDt":"08/09/2019","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"GRI","gradingBasisShort":"GradeNoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Letter grades only (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"05/29/2019","sessionEndDt":"08/06/2019","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This course teaches the basic skills for acquisition, management, and visualization of large datasets.

Salsa derives from the Cuban rhythm of Son. As a music and dance form, it has acquired regional variations and absorbed influences from different parts of Latin America and other continents. Bachata and Merengue are quintessential dances of the Dominican Republic. Comparsa is a form of carnival line dance. Cha Cha Cha originates in Cuba, finds expression in Rock n' Roll and western pop music, and is traditionally danced \"contratiempo.\" In this course, we learn the basics of all of these dances. Instruction emphasizes the development of foundations in musical timing, rhythm, body movement, lead-follow connection and space use. Class begins with a stretch and body movement warm-up. We then teach dance step sequences across the floor, in rotating lines, as freestyle and in partner format. The skills learned in each dance are interrelated - as you improve in one you develop a sensibility for the others. By the end of this course you will be able to take Latin dance to a higher level and learn other partnered dances. No partner is necessary to register. Couple sign-up is encouraged. Partners rotate. This class is gender-free: each student is free to learn the lead or follow role.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, Spring, Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AT"},{"crseId":350373,"subject":"PE","catalogNbr":"1321","titleLong":"Recreational Golf","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1479,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"05/29/2019","endDt":"06/21/2019","instructors":[],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

Through lectures, readings, discussions, and short assignments, we will address contemporary challenges ranging from privacy in big data and social computing to the nature of innovation, property, and collaboration in a networked world. We will cover key areas of technology law and policy such as telecommunications and network policy; concentration and antitrust; free speech and the first amendment; intellectual property; and privacy, security and freedom of information. We will also address new ethical questions and controversies that law and policy has yet to sort out. Through this course you'll learn about the key frameworks, processes, and institutions that govern the contemporary world of technology, along with key theories and methods from the academic fields that shape and inform them (law, philosophy, economics, political science, communication, sociology, etc.). You'll also learn core writing and analytic skills central to success in the worlds of social science, law, policy, and many other settings. But above all you'll learn to engage critically and strategically with the worlds of information and technology around you, deciding what kind of information consumer, user, and citizen YOU want to be.  ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA-AS)","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring, Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"crseId":355099,"subject":"STS","catalogNbr":"2871","titleLong":"Evolution","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1019,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"06:00PM","timeEnd":"09:00PM","startDt":"06/24/2019","endDt":"08/02/2019","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":2,"netid":"bbj23","firstName":"Benjamin","middleName":"Bradford","lastName":"Johnson"}],"pattern":"MW","facilityDescr":"Corson-Mudd A409","bldgDescr":"Corson-Mudd","facilityDescrshort":"CMHA409","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"06/24/2019","endDt":"08/02/2019","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[{"subject":"BIOEE","catalogNbr":"2070","type":"C"}],"sessionCode":"6WK","sessionBeginDt":"06/24/2019","sessionEndDt":"08/02/2019","sessionLong":"Six Week Summer"}],"description":"Evolution is the central concept in biology.

It is also essential for laboratory animal veterinarians to have knowledge of research methodologies, and animal models of disease as well as a good understanding of state and federal regulations, and guidelines governing the use of animals. In addition, occupational health and safety, and animal facility design are important parts of an institutional animal care program, to which laboratory animal veterinarians have input.

Scheduling is organized by a designated student. Successful completion of the course requires an orientation, 40 hours of satisfactory supervised participation in the care of wild native animals over the course of one year at the Wildlife Health Center. Students are required to submit two case reports or alternatives approved by the course leader, and a log of clinical hours and attending house officer/faculty (see template of table on course home page). To be able to register, students are required to first complete the 40 hours, the hour log, and the case reports then send these documents to the course leader. Deadlines for submission of the material are April 15th and November 15th.
