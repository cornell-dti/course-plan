The development of Salsa as a dance form follows its development as a musical genre. Bachata and Merengue, meanwhile, are considered quintessential dances of the Dominican Republic. Comparsa is Cuban Carnival line dance. In this course, we learn the basics of all of these dances. Instruction emphasizes the development of dance foundations in musical timing, rhythm, body movement, lead-follow connection, and space use. Class begins with a stretching and body movement warm-up. We then teach dance steps and movement patterns across the floor, in rotating lines, as freestyle, and in partner format. The skills learned in each dance are interrelated - as you improve in one you will improve in the others. Dancing with live percussion at one or more of our classes will help connect the dots of timing, rhythm and motion. By the end of this course you will be able to take Latin dance to a higher level and pick up other partnered dances. No partner is necessary to register. Couple sign-up is encouraged. Partners rotate. This class is gender-free. Each student is free to learn the lead or follow role.","enrollGroups":[{"unitsMaximum":1,"unitsMinimum":1,"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","meetings":[{"pattern":"TR","timeStart":"07:25PM","timeEnd":"08:55PM","instructors":[{"netid":"bar28","firstName":"Brigitta","lastName":"Putnam"}]}]}]}],"catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AT"},{"subject":"PE","crseId":350373,"catalogNbr":"1321","titleLong":"Recreational Golf","description":"Students must play a minimum of 10 rounds of nine holes to receive credit.","enrollGroups":[{"unitsMaximum":1,"unitsMinimum":1,"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","meetings":[{"pattern":"","timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","instructors":[{"netid":"jmb72","firstName":"James","lastName":"Baughan"}]}]}]},{"unitsMaximum":1,"unitsMinimum":1,"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","meetings":[{"pattern":"","timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","instructors":[]}]}]}],"catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: experienced golfers.","catalogComments":"All Faculty/Staff/non-students must purchase a course membership to play there.

The course will also examine how and why different situations, especially social situations, channel behavior in particular directions, minimizing and overcoming differences between individuals. In discussing these themes, the course will address such questions as: Why do we hold stereotypes? How do we decide what motivates other people's actions? How are beliefs and attitudes formed and changed? How do invisible social norms influence our behavior? What factors determine whom we like and love? What is the nature of emotional experience? Why are people capable of great cruelty and inspiring altruism?
