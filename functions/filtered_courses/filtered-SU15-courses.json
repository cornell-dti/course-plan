Students will learn about noted patrons of the arts, such as the Medici family in Renaissance Italy, our main focus will be on the creation of a global art market in the twentieth century.

Philosophers and poets for a few thousand years have contemplated the close kinship between madness and genius and have engaged in lively discussions about changing definitions of creativity as either ingenuity, inspiration, or insanity; as stemming from divine possession, originality, or fanatic enthusiasm. By reading philosophical and medical treatises, by examining texts of fiction and lyric poetry, as well as by including historical accounts, this course will find out when and why our culture decided to call a madman a genius and a genius mad. We shall trace the history of social and artistic transgression and analyze when and why a culture considers great talent as \"too different,\" as \"pathological,\" or as \"un-normal.\" You shall read texts ranging from Antiquity to the 18th and 20th centuries and encounter authors from Germany, France, Britain, and the United States. Guest lecturers from various Humanities departments will expand our view on genius as either a human condition, an artistic invention or the delusive state of \"madness.\"","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"Taught in English.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Does not count toward major or minor.","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"crseId":351395,"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"1111","titleLong":"Introduction to American Government and Politics","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1303,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:00AM","timeEnd":"11:15AM","startDt":"06/22/2015","endDt":"07/31/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"rjs24","firstName":"Robert","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Spitzer"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"White Hall 106","bldgDescr":"White Hall","facilityDescrshort":"WHT106","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

This course will enhance your ability to understand those forces and the policies that they produce. It will provide you with tools for thinking about, assessing, and evaluating those policies. And it will introduce you to the substantive core of several major issues in America today. The course will have three segments. In the first, we will examine the relevant institutions, interests, and ideologies which operate in the policy arena and the debates about the impact of these forces which engage students of the policy process. In the second, we will consider two different lenses through which we might peer to evaluate policies. In the third, we will discuss the main lines of debate in contemporary American politics concerning four substantive issues: crime and punishment, education, the economy and foreign trade, and foreign policy. The course will meet four days a week for one hour.

This course seeks to answer these questions by exploring the history of modern Europe. Among other themes, we will discuss the Protestant Reformation, the rise of absolutism, the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, industrialism, colonialism, the Russian Revolution, the two world wars, decolonization and immigration, May '68, and the construction of the European Union. In conjunction, we will examine how modern ideologies (liberalism, Marxism, imperialism, conservatism, fascism, totalitarianism) were developed and challenged. Through a wide array of historical documents (fiction, letters, philosophy, treatises, manifestos, films, and art), we will consider why \"old Europe\" is still relevant for us today.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"Each student must enroll in a section.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"crseId":367094,"subject":"HIST","catalogNbr":"1571","titleLong":"American Military History from the World Ward to 9/11, Iraq and Afghanistan, 1900-2014","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1342,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"11:45AM","startDt":"06/08/2015","endDt":"07/31/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":5,"netid":"ds90","firstName":"David","middleName":"","lastName":"Silbey"}],"pattern":"TR","facilityDescr":"Wolpe Center 118","bldgDescr":"Wolpe Center","facilityDescrshort":"WLP118","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in Washington, DC.

susceptible to such flaws; approaching business problems systematically and thoroughly; and producing a problem solution that is (a) well-reasoned; (b) likely to be well-received by ultimate decision makers; and (c) able to be implemented successfully.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall.","catalogComments":"Johnson School core

Salsa, arguably the most popular social dance in the world, derives from the Cuban rhythm of Son, while it grew to world fame through its growth in New York City and Puerto Rico. The development of Salsa as a dance form follows its development as a musical genre. Bachata and Merengue, meanwhile, are considered quintessential dances of the Dominican Republic. Comparsa is Cuban Carnival line dance. In this course, we learn the basics of all of these dances. Instruction emphasizes the development of dance foundations in musical timing, rhythm, body movement, lead-follow connection, and space use. Class begins with a stretching and body movement warm-up. We then teach dance steps and movement patterns across the floor, in rotating lines, as freestyle, and in partner format. The skills learned in each dance are interrelated - as you improve in one you will improve in the others. Dancing with live percussion at one or more of our classes will help connect the dots of timing, rhythm and motion. By the end of this course you will be able to take Latin dance to a higher level and pick up other partnered dances. No partner is necessary to register. Couple sign-up is encouraged. Partners rotate. This class is gender-free. Each student is free to learn the lead or follow role.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AT"},{"crseId":350373,"subject":"PE","catalogNbr":"1321","titleLong":"Recreational Golf","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"002","classNbr":1413,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"05/27/2015","endDt":"06/19/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"jmb72","firstName":"James","middleName":"M.","lastName":"Baughan"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":"Cornell Golf Center 101","bldgDescr":"Cornell Golf Center","facilityDescrshort":"CGC101","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

The class will consider traditional tools of political and social satire, including Commedia dellArte.  Fundamental in commedia is the exploration of status, the gradation of power and influence and role-playing.

Humans are a social species and our connection to others is a core element of our experience. The course will examine how and why different people act differently in the same situation, sometimes as a result of the culture in which they were raised, the family in which they grew up, or the genetic make-up they inherited. The course will also examine how and why different situations, especially social situations, channel behavior in particular directions, minimizing and overcoming differences between individuals. In discussing these themes, the course will address such questions as: Why do we hold stereotypes? How do we decide what motivates other people's actions? How are beliefs and attitudes formed and changed? How do invisible social norms influence our behavior? What factors determine whom we like and love? What is the nature of emotional experience? Why are people capable of great cruelty and inspiring altruism? Along the way, students will learn how these questions can be scientifically studied, so that our knowledge of human behavior can rest on a solid foundation and go beyond the speculations offered by philosophers, poets, and other astute observers for millennia.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"crseId":353568,"subject":"PSYCH","catalogNbr":"1500","titleLong":"Introduction to Environmental Psychology","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1260,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"01:00PM","timeEnd":"02:15PM","startDt":"06/22/2015","endDt":"07/31/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"bes96","firstName":"Bonnie","middleName":"Eaton","lastName":"Sanborn"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"Uris Hall 262","bldgDescr":"Uris Hall","facilityDescrshort":"URH262","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

These theories, which are covered in the first two segments of the course, provide some insight into where society is going and what challenges have emerged along the way.  In the third segment of the course, we will look more closely at the role of individuals and everyday interaction in the genesis of social phenomena.  We will explore theories about what motivates individuals' social behavior, the role of rationality and emotion, how the micromechanics of interpersonal contact can shape larger society, and the subtle links between biological and social processes.  In the final segment of the course, we will explore complex webs that emerge through social actors' connections to each other, and how these network structures have been shaped by the various processes that were examined during the semester.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"crseId":351429,"subject":"SOC","catalogNbr":"3310","titleLong":"Modern European Politics","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1328,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:00AM","timeEnd":"06:00PM","startDt":"05/31/2015","endDt":"06/20/2015","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"crw12","firstName":"Christopher","middleName":"Robert","lastName":"Way"}],"pattern":"MTWRFSu","facilityDescr":"To Be Assigned","bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":"TBA","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Offered in Turin.

The class will consider traditional tools of political and social satire, including Commedia dellArte.  Fundamental in commedia is the exploration of status, the gradation of power and influence and role-playing.
