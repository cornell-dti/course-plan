It helps men to rise above themselves,\" wrote Albert Camus in The Plague. Now is our time to realize our humanity: find out what sets us apart, and brings us together, as humans, and live up to it. This course is an existential odyssey into the human condition and politics. Are we truly different from animals and machines? What does it mean to \"be yourself\"? What's the difference between freedom and liberty? Should we pursue happiness? Why do we yield to fear and anxiety? Is the search for meaning meaningless? Do we live in a post-truth era? What are the roles of morality in our society and politics? Why is God dead, but religion alive? Can we defeat alienation? Is love all we need? How much can, and should, we hope for? In this course, utilizing edX HOPE (Human Odyssey to Political Existentialism; see https://tinyurl.com/hope44), we will address these questions, and then some more. We shall examine a dozen themes, entwining each with critical reflections, both personal and political, amidst the current crisis: Human/nature, identity &amp; authenticity, freedom, reflection, happiness, death &amp; dread, meaning, morality, truth &amp; trust, God &amp; religion, alienation &amp; love, and finally – hope.

a diverse field in which veterinarians directly impact on the well-being of animals used in research, teaching and testing. Lab animal veterinarians assist researchers in achieving their goals, while encouraging replacement, reduction, and refinement of animal use.

It is also essential for laboratory animal veterinarians to have knowledge of research methodologies, and animal models of disease as well as a good understanding of state and federal regulations, and guidelines governing the use of animals. In addition, occupational health and safety, and animal facility design are important parts of an institutional animal care program, to which laboratory animal veterinarians have input.

(NNS) clinical rotation at Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine is a 2 week time period in which the student is directly involved in the diagnosis, management and treatment of animals with a diverse array of neurologic disorders. Gait evaluation and the neurological examination are skills that can be applied to any species and these are emphasized over the rotation. During the rotation students will have multiple opportunities to practice and get feedback on their neurological examinations as we are often busy. This allows students time and practice so that they can apply what they have learned to whichever species they intend to work with following graduation. We have previously discussed other species with neurological conditions and examinations when students have made their interests known. Although clinics is primarily devoted to dogs and cats, we occasionally consult with other services such as large animal medicine and surgery and exotics. The student is expected to assist in all aspects of the rotation, including case rounds, patient receiving, medical and surgical treatments, client communication, and record-keeping. In addition to learning through clinical exposure, the student will be taught principles of clinical neurology during \"sit-down\" topic rounds. The primary goal of the rotation for the student is for the student to become comfortable and confident in performing and correctly interpreting the neurologic examination in a clinical setting.  A secondary goal is the accumulation and application of practical clinical knowledge pertaining to neurologic diseases of companion animals. To do this effectively we discuss our clinical approach to cases so that students can practice their clinical decision making skills and approach to neurological patients.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: VTMED 5510.","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"VM","acadGroup":"VM"},{"crseId":361925,"subject":"VTMED","catalogNbr":"6620","titleLong":"Introduction to Ambulatory Primary Care Medicine","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"CLN","ssrComponentLong":"Clinical","section":"301","classNbr":1077,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"12/21/2020","endDt":"01/24/2021","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"js448","firstName":"Jessica","middleName":"Anne Allerton","lastName":"McArt"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"12/21/2020","endDt":"01/24/2021","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["CLN"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"12/21/2020","sessionEndDt":"01/24/2021","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"CLN","ssrComponentLong":"Clinical","section":"302","classNbr":1083,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"12/21/2020","endDt":"01/24/2021","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"js448","firstName":"Jessica","middleName":"Anne Allerton","lastName":"McArt"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"12/21/2020","endDt":"01/24/2021","addConsent":"I","addConsentDescr":"Instructor Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["CLN"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"12/21/2020","sessionEndDt":"01/24/2021","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"This a clinical service rotation in which students accompany ambulatory clinicians on a farm and stable calls and learn the skills and procedures necessary for operation of a modern veterinary practice offering primary care and production medicine services to large animal clients.
