This \"American exceptionalism\" -- the turn to mass incarceration -- has been fostered by the use of sharply-delineated categories that define vast numbers of people as outlaws and others as law-abiding. These categories that are based on ideas of personal responsibility and assumptions about race are modified somewhat by a liberal commitment to human rights.   Our purpose in this course is to understand how such ideas have taken root and to locate the consequences of these ideas for policy and practice. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA-AS)","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, winter, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"crseId":366670,"subject":"GOVT","catalogNbr":"3434","titleLong":"Chinese Empire and the Cambodian Experience","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"FLD","ssrComponentLong":"Field Studies","section":"801","classNbr":1021,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:00AM","timeEnd":"06:00PM","startDt":"01/01/2018","endDt":"01/18/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"am847","firstName":"Andrew","middleName":"","lastName":"Mertha"}],"pattern":"MTWRFS","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Winter Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

How can they take advantage of the global marketplace and create economic value through their multimarket activities? This course has three integrated objectives: first, to give you a basic grounding in global business, so that you can become capable of understanding and analyzing events and trends in the global business environment and their impact on managerial decision making; second, to help you understand the analytical frameworks on strategy formulation and implementation in an international context; and third, through a series of concrete case discussions and a local product internationalization project, the course aims at developing your practical skills in applying the tools of global strategic analysis in concrete business situations. Its ultimate goal is to help you become better prepared to serve in and lead business organizations in today's globalized world.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Winter.","catalogComments":"Johnson School students will not receive credit for winter session courses offered through Continuing Education.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"crseId":362017,"subject":"NMI","catalogNbr":"5000","titleLong":"Directed Reading and Research","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"601","classNbr":1050,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/02/2018","endDt":"01/20/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"eai1","firstName":"Elena","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Iankova"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/02/2018","endDt":"01/20/2018","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":0.5,"unitsMaximum":3.38,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"WS","sessionBeginDt":"01/02/2018","sessionEndDt":"01/20/2018","sessionLong":"Winter Session"}],"description":"Students undertake special-interest research under the supervision of faculty members.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"crseId":351456,"subject":"NS","catalogNbr":"1150","titleLong":"Nutrition, Health, and Society","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1016,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/02/2018","endDt":"01/20/2018","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"dal4","firstName":"David","middleName":"A.","lastName":"Levitsky"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Online Winter Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.
