Sculpture can also be made out of literally anything, and each \"anything\" already comes with its own meanings and associations. All of these are givens, even before we decide what our work is about. This is what makes sculpture so powerful and exciting, and also so challenging. This course begins by exploring these givens though a number of very specific assignments and discussions.

We will examine some of the persistent dilemmas of politics and the attempts of several canonical political theorists to respond to them: Plato, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, and Nietzsche. In each case, we will attend to the particular crises these theorists addressed in their work—such as imperialism, the European wars of religion, the English Civil War, the French Revolution, and industrial capitalism—as well as the broader philosophical and political issues they continue to pose to us now. Our approach will be both historical and conceptual, providing students with an understanding of political theory as a distinctive form of political inquiry.","enrollGroups":[{"unitsMaximum":4,"unitsMinimum":4,"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","meetings":[{"pattern":"","timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","instructors":[{"netid":"am63","firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Moon"}]},{"pattern":"","timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","instructors":[]}]}]}],"catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogBreadth":"(HB)","catalogDistr":"(HA-AS)","catalogAttribute":"","catalogComments":"Although not a prerequisite, GOVT 1615 can be taken in sequence with  GOVT 3626.","catalogCourseSubfield":"(PT)","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"subject":"GOVT","crseId":351398,"catalogNbr":"1817","titleLong":"Making Sense of World Politics","description":"An introduction to the basic concepts and practice of international politics with an emphasis on learning critical thinking.  The course is divided into two parts.
