It is in our space, it makes us move in a certain way and it makes us want to move in a certain way. Because sculpture is physical like us, we respond to it on a visceral level. Sculpture can also be made out of literally anything, and each \"anything\" already comes with its own meanings and associations. All of these are givens, even before we decide what our work is about. This is what makes sculpture so powerful and exciting, and also so challenging. This course begins by exploring these givens though a number of very specific assignments and discussions. After a level of class-wide proficiency has been attained each student will develop their own line of inquiry and develop highly individualized projects.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Free elective for B.F.A. students.","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AR"},{"crseId":371151,"subject":"ART","catalogNbr":"1601","titleLong":"Introduction to Digital Photography","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"STU","ssrComponentLong":"Studio","section":"501","classNbr":1863,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"06/22/2020","endDt":"07/31/2020","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"bap8","firstName":"Barry","middleName":"Allan","lastName":"Perlus"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"06/22/2020","endDt":"07/31/2020","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"OL","instrModeDescrshort":"OL","instrModeDescr":"Online","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":3,"unitsMaximum":3,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["STU"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"6WK","sessionBeginDt":"06/22/2020","sessionEndDt":"07/31/2020","sessionLong":"Six Week Summer"}],"description":null,"catalogBreadth":null,"catalogDistr":null,"catalogAttribute":null,"catalogWhenOffered":null,"catalogComments":null,"catalogPrereqCoreq":null,"catalogSatisfiesReq":null,"acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AR"},{"crseId":354267,"subject":"ART","catalogNbr":"2201","titleLong":"Painting: Introduction to Painting","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"STU","ssrComponentLong":"Studio","section":"501","classNbr":1026,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:30AM","timeEnd":"11:00AM","startDt":"06/22/2020","endDt":"07/31/2020","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"gf264","firstName":"Gail","middleName":"","lastName":"Fitzgerald"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

Even purely domestic firms have to deal with international issues, be it in the form of imported supplies or foreign competitors. In addition, more and more companies are going abroad to pursue their major business objectives. How can they take advantage of the global marketplace and create economic value through their multimarket activities? This course has three integrated objectives: first, to give you a basic grounding in global business, so that you can become capable of understanding and analyzing events and trends in the global business environment and their impact on managerial decision making; second, to help you understand the analytical frameworks on strategy formulation and implementation in an international context; and third, through a series of concrete case discussions and a local product internationalization project, the course aims at developing your practical skills in applying the tools of global strategic analysis in concrete business situations. Its ultimate goal is to help you become better prepared to serve in and lead business organizations in today's globalized world.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Winter, Summer.","catalogComments":"Johnson School students will not receive credit for winter session courses offered through Continuing Education.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"crseId":350671,"subject":"NBA","catalogNbr":"6650","titleLong":"The Strategic Management of Technology and Innovation","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1387,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"06/22/2020","endDt":"07/10/2020","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"xs255","firstName":"Xirong","middleName":"","lastName":"Shen"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

This course is designed for students who may someday work in, consult for, and/or create firms whose primary product is fundamentally related to technology or innovation. The course typically includes both M.B.A. students and graduate students in science. It starts by examining how industries are transformed by new technologies and how these patterns of industrial change generate both opportunity and high rates of firm failure. We will then explore the questions: Why do some technology leaders fail? and How do technology innovators successfully take on and replace incumbent firms? This leads to an examination of internal management issues, focusing on the design of innovative organizations: designing reward systems, managing growth, overcoming resistance to change, and using organizational culture to promote innovation.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"crseId":362429,"subject":"NBAB","catalogNbr":"5970","titleLong":"Global Business Project","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1823,"meetings":[],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"05/27/2020","endDt":"08/04/2020","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"SD","instrModeDescrshort":"DL-SD","instrModeDescr":"Distance Learning-Synchronous","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"BMT","gradingBasisShort":"Multi-Term","gradingBasisLong":"Multi-Term Course: Not Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"05/27/2020","sessionEndDt":"08/04/2020","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"},{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"002","classNbr":1824,"meetings":[],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"05/27/2020","endDt":"08/04/2020","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"SD","instrModeDescrshort":"DL-SD","instrModeDescr":"Distance Learning-Synchronous","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"BMT","gradingBasisShort":"Multi-Term","gradingBasisLong":"Multi-Term Course: Not Graded","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"05/27/2020","sessionEndDt":"08/04/2020","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"The Global Business Project is a team-based, team-directed project conducted with the guidance of Project Advisor.

The first part of the course introduces students to the long, but often overlooked, history of environmental city development in the western planning tradition. The second part of the course reviews present-day efforts to apply these approaches in the face of modern metropolitan challenges to creating ecologically responsible cities.
