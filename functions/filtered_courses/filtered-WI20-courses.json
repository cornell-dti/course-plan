During the 2+ week field component in January (BIOEE 2526), students travel among field sites in Patagonia and put this knowledge to work in an experiential context by designing and implementing a series of research projects, including numerous short 'blitz' projects and several longer, more intensive independent projects; many of these field studies involve close-hand observations of marine mammals, penguins, or other seabirds.

In addition, more and more companies are going abroad to pursue their major business objectives. How can they take advantage of the global marketplace and create economic value through their multimarket activities? This course has three integrated objectives: first, to give you a basic grounding in global business, so that you can become capable of understanding and analyzing events and trends in the global business environment and their impact on managerial decision making; second, to help you understand the analytical frameworks on strategy formulation and implementation in an international context; and third, through a series of concrete case discussions and a local product internationalization project, the course aims at developing your practical skills in applying the tools of global strategic analysis in concrete business situations. Its ultimate goal is to help you become better prepared to serve in and lead business organizations in today's globalized world.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Winter, Summer.","catalogComments":"Johnson School students will not receive credit for winter session courses offered through Continuing Education.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"crseId":370037,"subject":"NBAE","catalogNbr":"5600","titleLong":"Introduction to FinTech, Finnovation and Finalytics","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1094,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/05/2020","endDt":"01/10/2020","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"lc898","firstName":"Will","middleName":"","lastName":"Cong"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/05/2020","endDt":"01/10/2020","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"12/23/2019","sessionEndDt":"01/19/2020","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"crseId":363991,"subject":"NBAE","catalogNbr":"5680","titleLong":"Management Presentations","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1113,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/05/2020","endDt":"01/10/2020","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"anj1","firstName":"Angela","middleName":"","lastName":"Noble-Grange"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"01/05/2020","endDt":"01/10/2020","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":1,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["LEC"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"12/23/2019","sessionEndDt":"01/19/2020","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"Effective communication is a key leadership/management competency.

Even in the United States, where ownership dispersion is at its highest, founding families exercise a significant degree of control over more than half of all public corporations. This course explores the challenges and opportunities created by family leadership and ownership. This elective is designed for students who may be involved in family firms and closely held companies in a variety of roles: joining either their own family's or someone else's firm, and students who will do business with family firms, consult to them, invest in them, work with them in private wealth management, mergers and acquisitions, banking, consulting etc. Through case studies, lectures, student projects and guest speakers, the course provides students with exposure to the unique finance, governance, and management issues faced by family firms, and ways in which these issues can be addressed. The course provides students with a framework for analyzing how family ownership, control, and management affect value, and whether and how more value can be created for the various stakeholders. The course brings an integrated financial and managerial perspective to the study of family firms focusing on the financial and corporate governance aspects of family control and their managerial implications. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"GM","acadGroup":"BU"},{"crseId":367049,"subject":"NBAY","catalogNbr":"5920","titleLong":"ITrek Trip","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"FLD","ssrComponentLong":"Field Studies","section":"801","classNbr":1091,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"01/05/2020","endDt":"01/15/2020","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"rjb397","firstName":"Ronald","middleName":"Jay","lastName":"Brachman"}],"pattern":"MTWRFSSu","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":null}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"Taught in Israel."}],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"OTHINTL","locationDescr":"Other International","startDt":"01/05/2020","endDt":"01/15/2020","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":"Israel"}],"unitsMinimum":1.5,"unitsMaximum":1.5,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["FLD"],"gradingBasis":"SUI","gradingBasisShort":"S/U NoAud","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (no audit)","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"1","sessionBeginDt":"12/23/2019","sessionEndDt":"01/19/2020","sessionLong":"Regular Academic Session"}],"description":"iTrek is a 10-day academic and cultural trip offering students of varying backgrounds an opportunity to be exposed to and learn about the growing economy of innovation in Israel with a focus on the established startup ecosystem.

The student is expected to assist in all aspects of the rotation, including case rounds, patient receiving, medical and surgical treatments, client communication, and record-keeping.
