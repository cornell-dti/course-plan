This course explores the challenges and opportunities created by family leadership and ownership. This elective is designed for students who may be involved in family firms and closely held companies in a variety of roles: joining either their own family's or someone else's firm, and students who will do business with family firms, consult to them, invest in them, work with them in private wealth management, mergers and acquisitions, banking, consulting etc. Through case studies, lectures, student projects and guest speakers, the course provides students with exposure to the unique finance, governance, and management issues faced by family firms, and ways in which these issues can be addressed. The course provides students with a framework for analyzing how family ownership, control, and management affect value, and whether and how more value can be created for the various stakeholders.

Student clinicians are supervised by rotation faculty and supported by licensed veterinary technicians.","enrollGroups":[{"unitsMaximum":2,"unitsMinimum":2,"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"CLN","meetings":[{"pattern":"","timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","instructors":[{"netid":"bgc2","firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Collins"}]}]}]},{"unitsMaximum":2,"unitsMinimum":2,"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"CLN","meetings":[{"pattern":"","timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","instructors":[{"netid":"bgc2","firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Collins"}]}]}]}],"catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer.","catalogAttribute":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"Required component of Clinical Rotations (Foundation Course VI).","acadCareer":"VM","acadGroup":"VM"},{"subject":"VTMED","crseId":350504,"catalogNbr":"5602","titleLong":"Small Animal Medicine","description":"Structured to provide supervised clinical experience in the practice of companion small-animal medicine.
