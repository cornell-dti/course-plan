We analyze the consistency between personal and professional ethics, the importance of moral character and agency, and the translation of moral thought to ethical action, and address the development of professional and personal ethical codes of conduct and research for communication professionals in the areas of new media and technology.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(CA) (KCM)","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG"},{"crseId":358523,"subject":"CS","catalogNbr":"1109","titleLong":"Fundamental Programming Concepts","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1174,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:00AM","timeEnd":"11:00AM","startDt":"06/27/2016","endDt":"08/05/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"sh954","firstName":"Soroush","middleName":"","lastName":"Alamdari"}],"pattern":"MTWR","facilityDescr":"Hollister Hall 362","bldgDescr":"Hollister Hall","facilityDescrshort":"HLS362","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

This course considers development as an evolving world project and from the perspective of its social and ecological impact: asking questions about costs and benefits of economic growth, about the global context (geo-political, institutional, production, consumption, and discursive relations), and the sustainability of various models. We relate development trends in the South/Third World with those in the North/First World. We also examine shared, global issues, such as the environment, human rights, security, and their condition in different parts of the world. In examining development historically, we encourage students to situate trends shaping the twenty-first century world, and how they can contribute, as global citizens, to the ongoing debate about how to reformulate development as an inclusive an empowering social process.\nThis course combines Lectures with discussion, and uses films and section discussions to promote reflection on diversity of cultures and understandings of human development. It also includes a special component (access by instructor permission), in conjunction with Cornell's Writing in the Majors Program. This is worth an additional credit hour, and is for advanced students. These students will meet additionally in weekly Sections with a Writing Instructor from Development Sociology for a special topic focus to enhance understanding of course material as well as writing skills.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(SBA) (HA) (D)","catalogAttribute":"(CU-SBY)","catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG"},{"crseId":354444,"subject":"DSOC","catalogNbr":"2750","titleLong":"Immigration and a Changing America","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1407,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"06/13/2016","endDt":"08/05/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"kjs256","firstName":"Kathleen","middleName":"Jean Delores","lastName":"Sexsmith"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Online Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

How well are the new immigrants integrating in the economy and society?

Philosophers and poets for a few thousand years have contemplated the close kinship between madness and genius and have engaged in lively discussions about changing definitions of creativity as either ingenuity, inspiration, or insanity; as stemming from divine possession, originality, or fanatic enthusiasm. By reading philosophical and medical treatises, by examining texts of fiction and lyric poetry, as well as by including historical accounts, this course will find out when and why our culture decided to call a madman a genius and a genius mad. We shall trace the history of social and artistic transgression and analyze when and why a culture considers great talent as \"too different,\" as \"pathological,\" or as \"un-normal.\" You shall read texts ranging from Antiquity to the 18th and 20th centuries and encounter authors from Germany, France, Britain, and the United States.

their work—such as the European wars of religion, the English Civil War, colonialism, the French Revolution, and industrial capitalism—as well as the broader philosophical and political issues they continue to pose to us now.  Our approach will be both historical and conceptual, in other words, with the hopes of providing students with a nuanced but clear understanding of political theory as a

In the second, we will consider two different lenses through which we might peer to evaluate policies. In the third, we will discuss the main lines of debate in contemporary American politics concerning four substantive issues: crime and punishment, education, the economy and foreign trade, and foreign policy.

The usual add/drop policy applies, and retroactive credit for work commenced after an academic semester has ended is not allowed. Projects are conducted under the direction of a faculty member, and regular, frequent consultations are mandatory. Also, a written report must be produced and made available to all faculty members and students of the school after its submission to the supervising faculty member. Up to 3 credits for independent study projects may not count toward the SHA elective requirements. Any over 3 credits will be free electives only. Students cannot earn academic credit for independent study when the equivalent material is offered in a regular course, and credit is not earned for teaching a course.

Students learn to use statistical software and simulation tools to discover fundamental results. They use computers regularly; the test includes both multimedia materials and a software package. This course does not focus on data from any particular discipline, but will use real-world examples from a wide variety of disciplines and current events.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, winter, spring, summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: introductory algebra.","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"IL"},{"crseId":363013,"subject":"ILRST","catalogNbr":"5100","titleLong":"Statistical Methods for the Social Sciences I","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1224,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"11:30AM","startDt":"06/01/2016","endDt":"06/24/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"tjd9","firstName":"Thomas","middleName":"J.","lastName":"Diciccio"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"Ives Hall 215","bldgDescr":"Ives Hall","facilityDescrshort":"IVS215","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

The course is offered on an accelerated basis. The course introduces students to basic business concepts that are fundamental to business practice and to upper-level business courses, but that many students are unlikely to be familiar with if they did not major in business at the undergraduate level. In particular, the course will provide a basic introduction to the following concepts: Debt, Interest, and Present Value; Basic Business Forms (proprietorship, partnership, corporation, LLC); Capital Structure (equity, debt, and variations on the same like preferred and ABS); Basic Accounting (balance sheets, earnings statements, statements of cash flow); Basic Valuation (book value, discounted

Metropolitan transformation is explored in conjunction with alternative transportation, renewable energy, green infrastructure, recycling and resource management, and sustainable economics as means toward advancing cities to become the basis of an ecologically sound and socially just society. The first part of the course introduces students to the long, but often overlooked, history of environmental city development in the western planning tradition. The second part of the course reviews present-day efforts to apply these approaches in the face of modern metropolitan challenges to creating ecologically responsible cities. Specific case studies are studied within the theoretical context and political struggles that frame them. ","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-SBY)","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG"},{"crseId":361777,"subject":"NTRES","catalogNbr":"4990","titleLong":"Undergraduate Research","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"RSC","ssrComponentLong":"Research","section":"700","classNbr":1684,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"08:00AM","timeEnd":"04:30PM","startDt":"05/31/2016","endDt":"07/23/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mph75","firstName":"Matthew","middleName":"P.","lastName":"Hare"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"05/31/2016","endDt":"07/23/2016","addConsent":"D","addConsentDescr":"Department Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":"P","instrModeDescrshort":"In Person","instrModeDescr":"In Person","topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":6,"unitsMaximum":6,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["RSC"],"gradingBasis":"SUS","gradingBasisShort":"Sat/Unsat","gradingBasisLong":"Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"SP2","sessionBeginDt":"06/01/2016","sessionEndDt":"08/05/2016","sessionLong":"Summer Special Session 2"}],"description":"Undergraduate research projects in natural resources; contingent on finding a faculty person to work with.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"(CU-UGR)","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"Students must register using CALS Special Studies form available online.","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG"},{"crseId":354016,"subject":"NTRES","catalogNbr":"6970","titleLong":"Graduate Individual Study in Natural Resources","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"IND","ssrComponentLong":"Independent Study","section":"600","classNbr":1815,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","startDt":"06/13/2016","endDt":"08/05/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":1,"netid":"mek2","firstName":"Marianne","middleName":"Elizabeth","lastName":"Krasny"}],"pattern":"","facilityDescr":null,"bldgDescr":null,"facilityDescrshort":null,"meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[],"campus":"MAIN","campusDescr":"Ithaca","location":"ITH","locationDescr":"Ithaca, NY (Main Campus)","startDt":"06/13/2016","endDt":"08/05/2016","addConsent":"N","addConsentDescr":"No Special Consent Required","isComponentGraded":true,"instructionMode":null,"instrModeDescrshort":null,"instrModeDescr":null,"topicDescription":""}],"unitsMinimum":1,"unitsMaximum":4,"componentsOptional":[],"componentsRequired":["IND"],"gradingBasis":"OPT","gradingBasisShort":"Stdnt Opt","gradingBasisLong":"Letter or S/U grades","simpleCombinations":[],"sessionCode":"SP2","sessionBeginDt":"06/01/2016","sessionEndDt":"08/05/2016","sessionLong":"Summer Special Session 2"}],"description":"Study of topics in natural resources more advanced than, or different from, other courses.

Salsa, arguably the most popular social dance in the world, derives from the Cuban rhythm of Son, while it grew to world fame through its growth in New York City and Puerto Rico. The development of Salsa as a dance form follows its development as a musical genre. Bachata and Merengue, meanwhile, are considered quintessential dances of the Dominican Republic. Comparsa is Cuban Carnival line dance. In this course, we learn the basics of all of these dances. Instruction emphasizes the development of dance foundations in musical timing, rhythm, body movement, lead-follow connection, and space use. Class begins with a stretching and body movement warm-up. We then teach dance steps and movement patterns across the floor, in rotating lines, as freestyle, and in partner format. The skills learned in each dance are interrelated - as you improve in one you will improve in the others. Dancing with live percussion at one or more of our classes will help connect the dots of timing, rhythm and motion. By the end of this course you will be able to take Latin dance to a higher level and pick up other partnered dances. No partner is necessary to register. Couple sign-up is encouraged. Partners rotate. This class is gender-free. Each student is free to learn the lead or follow role.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AT"},{"crseId":350181,"subject":"PE","catalogNbr":"1261","titleLong":"Fitness and Conditioning","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1651,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"10:30AM","timeEnd":"11:30AM","startDt":"06/27/2016","endDt":"08/05/2016","instructors":[],"pattern":"MWR","facilityDescr":"Appel 101 Fitness Center","bldgDescr":"Appel","facilityDescrshort":"APP101","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

Humans are a social species and our connection to others is a core element of our experience. The course will examine how and why different people act differently in the same situation, sometimes as a result of the culture in which they were raised, the family in which they grew up, or the genetic make-up they inherited. The course will also examine how and why different situations, especially social situations, channel behavior in particular directions, minimizing and overcoming differences between individuals. In discussing these themes, the course will address such questions as: Why do we hold stereotypes? How do we decide what motivates other people's actions? How are beliefs and attitudes formed and changed? How do invisible social norms influence our behavior? What factors determine whom we like and love? What is the nature of emotional experience?

This course considers development as an evolving world project and from the perspective of its social and ecological impact: asking questions about costs and benefits of economic growth, about the global context (geo-political, institutional, production, consumption, and discursive relations), and the sustainability of various models. We relate development trends in the South/Third World with those in the North/First World. We also examine shared, global issues, such as the environment, human rights, security, and their condition in different parts of the world. In examining development historically, we encourage students to situate trends shaping the twenty-first century world, and how they can contribute, as global citizens, to the ongoing debate about how to reformulate development as an inclusive an empowering social process.\nThis course combines Lectures with discussion, and uses films and section discussions to promote reflection on diversity of cultures and understandings of human development. It also includes a special component (access by instructor permission), in conjunction with Cornell's Writing in the Majors Program.

Students will learn about noted patrons of the arts, such as the Medici family in Renaissance Italy, our main focus will be on the creation of a global art market in the twentieth century. Using case studies, sample topics include: patterns of transportation, exchange and trade; the interaction of collectors, critics and curators; the spaces and contexts of display of contemporary collections; auction houses and commercial galleries; and fakes, forgeries, thefts and scandals. Special attention will be paid to considering the contemporary art market (post 1980) and the collecting, exchange and valuation of film, photography, painting, performance and installation art. Global markets for the exchange of art in Asia, Europe, Africa, North America and South America will be highlighted as well as the exhibitions of contemporary art such as the Art Basel, the Cairo Biennale and the Venice Biennale that fuel these markets.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"(LA-AS)","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"","catalogSatisfiesReq":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AS"},{"crseId":363875,"subject":"VTBMS","catalogNbr":"1200","titleLong":"Veterinary Medicine: Science and Practice","enrollGroups":[{"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","ssrComponentLong":"Lecture","section":"001","classNbr":1336,"meetings":[{"classMtgNbr":1,"timeStart":"09:00AM","timeEnd":"12:00PM","startDt":"06/27/2016","endDt":"07/15/2016","instructors":[{"instrAssignSeq":3,"netid":"psm26","firstName":"Paul","middleName":"S.","lastName":"Maza"},{"instrAssignSeq":4,"netid":"avh6","firstName":"Allison","middleName":"","lastName":"Miller"}],"pattern":"MTWRF","facilityDescr":"Vet Research Tower T1003-LH3","bldgDescr":"Vet Research Tower","facilityDescrshort":"VRTT1003","meetingTopicDescription":""}],"notes":[{"classNotesSeq":1,"descrlong":"This Summer Session class is offered by the School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions.

Current knowledge of research methodologies and animal models of disease as well as a good understanding of state and federal regulations and guidelines governing the use of animals is essential for a laboratory animal veterinarian. In addition, occupational health and safety and animal facility design are important parts of an institutional animal care program and laboratory animal veterinarians have input in these areas.

These skills include the appropriate evaluation, stabilization, and treatment of emergency patients and the management of postoperative cases and other critical patients. Participants access relevant information from various sources related to emergency and critical-care medicine and surgery in an effort to understand and apply these principles to clinical cases. Participants primarily have patient care responsibilities in the Large-Animal Intensive Care Unit of the Cornell University Hospital for Animals and work closely with technicians and clinicians to develop familiarity with technical and nursing procedures.

Students will take part in all aspects of case management, by initially shadowing senior students, then functioning more independently as they gain more confidence, while under close supervision of residents and the Chief on duty. This will include practice with clinical histories, examination, neurolocalization, medical records, and treatments. Students will also participate in clinical and didactic teaching rounds.  Management, diagnostic, and treatment options for use in general and referral practices will be discussed.","catalogBreadth":"","catalogDistr":"","catalogAttribute":"","catalogWhenOffered":"Summer.","catalogComments":"","catalogPrereqCoreq":"Prerequisite: Familiarity with UVIS and ability to
