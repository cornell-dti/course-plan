We analyze the consistency between personal and professional ethics, the importance of moral character and agency, and the translation of moral thought to ethical action, and address the development of professional and personal ethical codes of conduct and research for communication professionals in the areas of new media and technology.","enrollGroups":[{"unitsMaximum":3,"unitsMinimum":3,"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"SEM","meetings":[{"pattern":"MTWRF","timeStart":"10:00AM","timeEnd":"12:30PM","instructors":[{"netid":"des14","firstName":"Dawn","lastName":"Schrader"}]}]}]}],"catalogWhenOffered":"Spring.","catalogDistr":"(CA) (KCM)","catalogAttribute":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"AG"},{"subject":"CS","crseId":358523,"catalogNbr":"1109","titleLong":"Fundamental Programming Concepts","description":"Designed for students who intend to take CS 111x but are not adequately prepared for it.

We relate development trends in the South/Third World with those in the North/First World. We also examine shared, global issues, such as the environment, human rights, security, and their condition in different parts of the world.

In particular, the course will provide a basic introduction to the following concepts: Debt, Interest, and Present Value; Basic Business Forms (proprietorship, partnership, corporation, LLC); Capital Structure (equity, debt, and variations on the same like preferred and ABS); Basic Accounting (balance sheets, earnings statements, statements of cash flow); Basic Valuation (book value, discounted cash flow, etc.); Securities Markets (a short introduction to the offering process and to the secondary markets for stocks, bonds, asset-back securities and derivatives).","enrollGroups":[{"unitsMaximum":1,"unitsMinimum":1,"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","meetings":[{"pattern":"","timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","instructors":[{"netid":"ls483","firstName":"Lynn","lastName":"Stout"}]}]}]}],"catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring.","catalogAttribute":"","acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"subject":"LAW","crseId":362917,"catalogNbr":"6095","titleLong":"Litigation in a Global Context:  Selected Issues","description":null,"enrollGroups":[{"unitsMaximum":1,"unitsMinimum":1,"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","meetings":[{"pattern":"","timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","instructors":[{"netid":"zdc6","firstName":"Zachary","lastName":"Clopton"}]}]}]}],"catalogAttribute":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"subject":"LAW","crseId":368352,"catalogNbr":"6148","titleLong":"Case Studies in International Human Rights","description":null,"enrollGroups":[{"unitsMaximum":1,"unitsMinimum":1,"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","meetings":[{"pattern":"","timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","instructors":[{"netid":"gt276","firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Torres"}]}]}]}],"catalogAttribute":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"subject":"LAW","crseId":368351,"catalogNbr":"6149","titleLong":"Central Banking and Monetary Law in Comparative Perspective","description":null,"enrollGroups":[{"unitsMaximum":1,"unitsMinimum":1,"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","meetings":[{"pattern":"","timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","instructors":[{"netid":"rch37","firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Hockett"}]}]}]}],"catalogAttribute":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"subject":"LAW","crseId":365357,"catalogNbr":"6177","titleLong":"Comparative Legal Studies","description":null,"enrollGroups":[{"unitsMaximum":1,"unitsMinimum":1,"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","meetings":[{"pattern":"","timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","instructors":[{"netid":"ml355","firstName":"Mitchel","lastName":"Lasser"}]}]}]}],"catalogAttribute":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"subject":"LAW","crseId":365354,"catalogNbr":"6181","titleLong":"International Commercial Arbitration","description":null,"enrollGroups":[{"unitsMaximum":2,"unitsMinimum":2,"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","meetings":[{"pattern":"","timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","instructors":[{"netid":"jjb16","firstName":"John","lastName":"Barcelo"}]}]}]}],"catalogAttribute":null,"acadCareer":"LA","acadGroup":"LA"},{"subject":"LAW","crseId":350777,"catalogNbr":"6460","titleLong":"Financial Accounting","description":"Introductory accounting course that examines the subject from the viewpoint of users external to the organization.

The development of Salsa as a dance form follows its development as a musical genre. Bachata and Merengue, meanwhile, are considered quintessential dances of the Dominican Republic. Comparsa is Cuban Carnival line dance. In this course, we learn the basics of all of these dances. Instruction emphasizes the development of dance foundations in musical timing, rhythm, body movement, lead-follow connection, and space use. Class begins with a stretching and body movement warm-up. We then teach dance steps and movement patterns across the floor, in rotating lines, as freestyle, and in partner format. The skills learned in each dance are interrelated - as you improve in one you will improve in the others. Dancing with live percussion at one or more of our classes will help connect the dots of timing, rhythm and motion. By the end of this course you will be able to take Latin dance to a higher level and pick up other partnered dances. No partner is necessary to register. Couple sign-up is encouraged. Partners rotate. This class is gender-free.
