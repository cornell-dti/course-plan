Students learn to use statistical software and simulation tools to discover fundamental results. They use computers regularly; the test includes both multimedia materials and a software package. This course does not focus on data from any particular discipline, but will use real-world examples from a wide variety of disciplines and current events.","enrollGroups":[{"unitsMaximum":4,"unitsMinimum":4,"classSections":[{"ssrComponent":"LEC","meetings":[{"pattern":"","timeStart":"","timeEnd":"","instructors":[{"netid":"brb225","firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Baer"}]}]}]}],"catalogWhenOffered":"Fall, spring, summer.","catalogDistr":"(MQR-AS)","catalogAttribute":"","acadCareer":"UG","acadGroup":"EN"},{"subject":"VISST","crseId":363031,"catalogNbr":"4696","titleLong":"The Art Market","description":"This course will examine the history of the art market, from the 16th century to the present.
